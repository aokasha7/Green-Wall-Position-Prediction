# Green-Wall-Position-Prediction
This code is part of an ongoing research for predicting the most effecient position to place a living wall on a building facade in order maintain the least energy required for heating or cooling loads.
The code utilizes a keras neural network and it has been trained and tested on energy requiremennt data simulated using DesignBuilder software simulated for several buildings located on several geographical locations in Egypt. The overall model accuracy was 95% in terms of predicting the best green wall position on the building facad.
